# Password Generator

When the user clicks "Generate Password" then they are asked the following prompts:

1. How many characters would you like the password to be, between 8 and 128 characters?
2. Would you like to include uppercase letters?
3. Would you like to include lowercase letters?
4. Would you like to include symbols?
5. Would you like to include numbers?

The program then generates a random password based on the user's parameters and will generate a new one each time the button is pressed.
